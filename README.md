### üçª Welcome stranger
- üéì: I am a first year PhD student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and supervised by Prof [Enhong Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/). Currently, I work as a research intern at Tencent AI Lab, mentored by [Zhirui Zhang](https://zrustc.github.io/). Prior to that, I was a Research Intern in the Language Technology Lab at Alibaba DAMO Academy.
- üéØ: I am working in the field of NLP & Data Mining. My research interests and past experience can be summarized as follows:
  - Multilingual and Multimodal Translation: End-to-End Speech Translation; Multilingual Neural Machine Translation
  - Data mining in healthcare: ICD coding; Extreme Multi-Label Classification
  - Knowledge Graph: Entity Linking

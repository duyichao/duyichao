### üçª Welcome stranger
- üéì: I am a  ~~first~~ second-year PhD student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by Professor [Enhong Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/). Currently, I am working as a research intern at Tencent AI Lab, mentored by [Zhirui Zhang](https://zrustc.github.io/). Prior to that, I worked as a research intern in the Language Technology Lab at Alibaba DAMO Academy.
- üéØ: I am working in the field of NLP & Data Mining. My research interests and past experience can be summarized as follows:
  - Pre-trained Language Models: Foundation Model; Multimodal LLM
  - Multilingual and Multimodal Translation: End-to-End Speech Translation; Multilingual Neural Machine Translation
  - Data mining in healthcare: ICD coding; Extreme Multi-Label Classification
  - Knowledge Graph: Entity Linking
 
### üì∞ What's New?
- **[2023-10-08]** Three papers are accepted by EMNLP'2023, about theoretical understanding of kNN-MT, interactive machine translation and interventional rationalization!
- **[2023-07-10]** Our MineTrans speech translation system is accepted by IWSLT'2023, which win the championship in the Speech-to-Speech Translation (End-to-End subtrack).
